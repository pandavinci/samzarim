# Samzarim
This is a world building project. The setting is a thriving ecosystem in a post-cataclysmic event. Races have recuperated and are looking to expand into the shattered world of flying islands above the endless ocean, under the endless sea of stars.

The adventurers may be tasked to move the cogs of commerce or help bring life as pioneers on the frontier. They may face the wrath of the native population, uncover ancient ruins and learn dark secrets of this world. Nothing is as it first seems in the world of Samzarim.

## Vampires
Followers of Julia, the Crimson. I have taken the liberty of redesigning vampires from scratch, trying to make them less predictable, whilst keeping their identity intact. The major characteristics of vampires are in my humble opinion: *powerful*, *unnatural abilities*, *taste for life*, *unaging/immortal*, *major weakness*. These are the characteristics each vampire has in my opinion, of course for a major vampire, you may scratch some. I will be looking mainly at the *unnatural abilities*, *taste for life* and *major weakness*. The most important thing when designing a vampire is in my opinion designing their major weakness. Let's scratch the notion of weakness to sunglight, garlic, crucifix etc. I think it is necessary for the players to be on edge when dealing with a vampire. Generally, if players find out they're dealing with a vampire, they immediately know their weakness and deal with them effectively. To design an interesting vampire, their weakness should be special and hidden. It may be tied to their transformation or an experience in their life before.

In this setting Vampires aren't undead. This is due to lore reasons and also to get rid of their general weaknesses. General weaknesses are bad for major encounters IMO (troll and fire). Finding out the weakness is part of the adventure and it is what makes the vampire threatening. The Vampire cannot be killed without utilizing its weakness. The Vampire may not be killed at all, maybe he can be restrained at most, sealed for eternity - a fitting punishment.

*Unnatural abilities* and *taste for life* categories are mainly flavour of the vampire. The vampire may create a clan or he may be a loner. The Vampire may be altruistic (Regis, Witcher 3) or self-interested. The Vampire may lack some of the major characteristics of a Vampire - don't scratch taste for life and major weakness. Make them fun.

Here are some tables for generating a vampire:
### Major weakness

| 8  | song/rhyme           | sung              | music box                 | sleep             | *as a tune plays* |
| 9  | flower               | placed            | sleeping                  | mist              | *turn to mist, bloodmist* |
| 10 | stake                | impaled           | blood moon                | teleported        | *some nasty place (Afterlands)* |
| 11 | weapon               | struck down       | circle                    | blood             | |
| 12 | artifact             | destroyed         | river                     | ash               |  |
| 13 | painting             | burned            | home                      | human             | *may be killed again in human form* |

| 15 | bell                 | rung              | mountain                  | holy symbols      | |
| 16 | special light        | shined            | unconsecrated cathedral   | crystalized       | *special lantern etc. \| blood crystal, amethyst, onyx...* |
| 17 | body part            | amputation        | petrified                 | trapped in vessel | *like a djinn* |
| 18 | seal                 | broken            | well                      | shards of glass   | |
| 19 | prison               | restrained        | grave                     | ghost             | |
| 20 | roll again, combine  | two applications  | Julia's cathedral         | servant           | *they become a servant to the party (ghost, vampire, human...)* |

There are some interesting combinations, anything is possible with a little creativity. Don't be afraid to combine effects regardless if they're rolled or not. Incantation may be inscribed into a sword which is used to strike down the vampire.

Some examples: Gesture, struck down, book, boiled - a gesture has to be performed before killing the vampire by piercing him with a silver sword through a holy book, the vampire starts boiling until they dissolve. Rope, shown, full moon, mist - hang 7 of his turned servants under full moon and show them to him, the vampire turns to mist never to be seen again.

Sometimes, it may be an overkill, you are free to simplify the process. Example: the servants only need to be hanged under full moon, the vampire doesn't have to see them for this to kill him. Another note, verbs like play, sing denote some song, the form may then be the theme of the song.

The PCs may be cursed by Julia or other force for performing an act of killing a powerful vampire. If this is the case, make sure the PCs have a way to find out about this beforehand. Consult curses table.

Vampires may fight against their weaknesses by hiding objects that endanger them, blinding, deafening themselves. The PCs will have to get creative. Sucessful vampires employ such tactics.

### Revival
When killed the vampire will recuperate after some time. If they can reassamble in their home, at some artifact etc. Tie their reassembly to their story. Otherwise, consult the table below

| 10   | Merciful Duelist   | Blood magic           | *Combination of previous, makes major use of blood and bodies as ingredients* |

### Taste for life
Each vampire desires the living in a different manner. The vampire is very hungry when young, after he grows older and his appetite is satied, they require their sustenance less often but in larger portions. The Consumption column is a twisted preference, not a requirement (unless you want it to be ;D).

| Roll | Taste | Consumption | How often | Note |
|------|-|-|-|-|
| 1    | Flesh                                  | With spice        | Each day             |

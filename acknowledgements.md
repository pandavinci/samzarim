Samzarim was created based on [Vaults of Vaarn](https://vaarn.github.io/#/), please check it out, it is an amazing project. The main inspiration was to combine a worldbuilding project with random tables for easy session preparation. Using *docsify* framework for website building was the other main inspiration.

Samzarim was written to be used alongside any major TTRPG system.

Samzarim was created for my DnD group, but I decided to present it publically so anyone may enjoy it.

This is my first proper worldbuilding project.

# Samzarim <small><small><sub>Player's guide</sub></small></small>
Samzarim is a shattered world cast into oblivion and chaotically merged with the rest of the elemental and non-elemental plain.

Samzarim consists of an endless layer of ocean, floating islands and impenetrable clouds. Isolated floating islands the size of continents are governed by numerous races which rose before and after the event known as Shattering. The Shattering was a war between two God-kings for the right to rule this world. One a conqueror who came from the stars and one a defender who freed the downtrodden race of humans from slavery.
